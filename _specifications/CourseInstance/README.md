TODO: This is TM spec - fill in for Course!
The Life Science Training Materials specification provides a way to describe bioscience training material on the World Wide Web. It defines a set of metadata and vocabularies, built on top of existing technologies and standards, that can be used to represent events in Web pages and applications. The goal of the specification is to make it easier to discover, exchange and integrate life science training material information across the Internet.
